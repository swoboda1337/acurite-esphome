ESPHome AcuRite OOK signal decoder, allowing for an easy integration of 433 MHz AcuRite weather sensors into Home Assistant. At the moment the following devices are supported: temperature / humidity sensor, rain gauge, notos weather station, iris weather station, atlas weather station,  lightning detector and fridge / freezer temperature sensor. Support for additional sensors can added if someone is available to test the changes.

The AcuRite component can be run without any sensors configured. Data received from all sensors will still be logged, this can be done to determine ids before setting up the sensor yaml.

A 433 MHz board that provides OOK data over a GPIO is required for this component to work. This component has been tested with the LILYGO LoRa32 V2.1_1.6 board using my [SX127x](https://github.com/swoboda1337/sx127x-esphome) component. Note the small 433 MHz antennas that come with these boards work fine but are not ideal. The antenna gain is really poor and it’s too close to the Wi-Fi antenna which can cause glitches. A proper antenna like the Siretta Tango 9 has better range and doesn’t glitch when Wi-Fi transmits.

It is recommended to use force_update so any statistics sensors in Home Assistant will work correctly. For example if the humidity stays at 99% all day, without force_update, a max/min statistics sensor would show unavailable as no data points will be logged. Using the delta and throttle filters will limit the amount of data being sent up and stored. 

As of November 2024, rain sensors no longer store anything in NVM and now output the current device total. This was done to make things more flexible. To restore the previous functionality of a lifetime total a lambda + two globals can be used:

    globals:
      - id: rainfall_total
        type: float
        restore_value: yes
      - id: rainfall_current
        type: float
        restore_value: yes

    sensor:
      - platform: acurite
        devices:
          - device: 0x2838
            rain:
              name: "Test Backyard Rainfall"
              force_update: true
              filters:
                - lambda: |-
                    // update rainfall state and save to nvm
                    if (x != id(rainfall_current)) {
                      float delta;
                      if (x >= id(rainfall_current)) {
                        delta = x - id(rainfall_current);
                      } else {
                        delta = x;
                      }
                      id(rainfall_total) += delta; // can apply a calibration value here
                      id(rainfall_current) = x;
                    }
                    return id(rainfall_total);
                - throttle: 50sec
                - timeout: 5min

An increasing total for rainfall is not very useful by itself. Here are some example sensors that can be added to Home Assistant's configuration.yaml

These sensors are window based and will calculate how much rain had fallen within the window:

    sensor:
      - platform: statistics
        name: "AcuRite Rainfall 15Min"
        entity_id: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        state_characteristic: change
        max_age:
          minutes: 15
      - platform: statistics
        name: "AcuRite Rainfall 1Hr"
        entity_id: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        state_characteristic: change
        max_age:
          hours: 1
      - platform: statistics
        name: "AcuRite Rainfall 24Hr"
        entity_id: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        state_characteristic: change
        max_age:
          hours: 24

These sensors will reset at specific times which is useful for daily, weekly or monthly:

    utility_meter:
      daily_rainfall:
        source: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        name: AcuRite Rainfall Daily
        always_available: true
        periodically_resetting: false
        cycle: daily
      weekly_rainfall:
        source: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        name: AcuRite Rainfall Weekly
        always_available: true
        periodically_resetting: false
        cycle: weekly
      monthly_rainfall:
        source: sensor.acurite_rainfall
        name: AcuRite Rainfall Monthly
        always_available: true
        periodically_resetting: false
        cycle: monthly

A binary moisture sensor can also be created using a template:

    {{states('sensor.acurite_rainfall_15min')|float > 0}}

For lightning detection the following example sensors that can be added to Home Assistant. These sensors will create a daily counter, daily closest distance, most recent distance and a binary sensor indicating if lightning has been detected recently. If there has been no strike today both closest and last will show 40km (max distance):

    utility_meter:
      daily_lightning:
        source: sensor.lightning_strikes
        name: "Lightning Strikes Daily"
        always_available: true
        periodically_resetting: true
        cron: "0 0 * * *"

For sensors in different physical locations (e.g., a bedroom), use sub-device configuration within your YAML to explicitly assign them to their correct areas. This ensures sensors are correctly mapped to their respective areas, rather than inheriting the main device's location.
